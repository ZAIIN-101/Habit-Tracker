Hello everyone my name is Abdulrahman zain I'm studying Business Information Systems 
I'm excited to share with you my final project of CS50P Course a simple habit tracker 
designed to make user able add his habits and track his progress visually
in order to improve his lifestyle now let's dive into the project
and see it working then later we discuss the how 

The project has four main features Add, mark , delete and dashboard visualization
to add a habit you will have to get right here give it a name and a description just click the add button right there
to mark it as done just press the check button
and if you changed your mind and want to undo what you did you just simply click the redo button here 
and to delete the habit suppose u don't need it anymore click the trash button then confirm your action now it's deleted
some of you maybe have wondered what's behind the dashboard button 
simply a bar chart represents the most repeated habit is Exercise and not only that 
if we got back quick we might notice the habit cards are clickable and that's maybe for a reason it's a heat map as in github with the help of some visualization libraries I was able to make this

now let's talk about the how it works
I started by applying what we learned in CS50P. I created project.py using object-oriented programming with a Habit class that handles adding, deleting, marking, unmarking, and generating charts.
For the interface, it would have made more sense if i just used the command line interface
I wanted something user friendly so user can interact with it which leads us to the web interface using html, css & flask as in CS50x Finally, I needed a way to store data. I considered JSON but decided to use SQLite because it’s more reliable and fit my needs better.

And that’s it I hope you found it interesting, You can explore the full code in my GitHub repository, linked below. I’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions.
